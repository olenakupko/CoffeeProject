# CoffeeProject
## Coffee Sales Dashboard.
### Business issue
Stakeholders want a bird's view on historical coffee sales to explore and compare different coffee types' sales trends. Additional requirements are to have a sales breakdown by country and top 5 customers.

## Result
It has been agreed to create a dashboard, that consists of 3 charts that represent sales over time, country breakdown, and the top five customers list. Information could be zoomed in and out by filters.
The sales data could be filtered by coffee type, roast type, pack size, loyalty card appliance, and time range
